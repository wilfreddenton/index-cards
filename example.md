**angle of framing**: the position of the frame in relation to the subject it shows: above it, looking down; horizontal, on the same level; looking up. Also called camera angle.

**canted framing**: a view in which the frame is not level; either the right or the left side is lower than the other, causing objects in the scene to appear slanted out on an upright position.

**cinematography**: a general term for all the manipulations of the film strip by the camera in the shooting phase and by the laboratory in the developing phase.

**close-up**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is relatively large; most commonly a person’s head seen from the neck up, or an object of a comparable size that fills most of the screen.

**closure**: the degree to which the ending of a narrative film reveals the effects of all the causal events and resolved all lines of action.

**continuity editing**: a system of cutting to maintain continuous and clear narrative action. Continuity editing relies on matching screen direction, position, and temporal relations from shot to shot.

**crane shot**: a shot with a change in framing accomplished by placing the camera above the subject and moving through the air in any direction.

**crosscutting**: editing that alternates shots of two or more lines of action occurring in different places, usually simultaneously.

**cut**: in filmmaking, the joining of two strips of film together with a splice. in a finished film, an instantaneous change from one framing to another.

**deep focus**: a use of the camera lens and lighting that keeps objects in both close and distant planes in sharp focus.

**deep space**: an arrangement of mise-en-scene elements so that there is a considerable distance between the plane closest to the camera and the one farthest away. Any or all of these planes may be in focus.

**diegetic sound**: any voice, musical passage, or sound effect presented as originating from a source within the film’s world.

**discontinuity editing**: any alternative system of joining shots together using techniques unacceptable within continuity editing principles.

**dissolve**: a transition between two shots during which the first image gradually disappears while the second image gradually appears; for a moment the two images blend in superimposition.

**dolly**: a camera support with wheels used in making tracking shots.

**dubbing**: the process of replacing part or all of the voices on the sound track in order to correct mistakes or rerecord dialogue.

**editing**: in filmmaking, the task of selecting and joining camera takes. in the finished film, the set of techniques that governs the relations among shots.

**establishing shot**: a shot, usually involving a distant framing, that shows the spatial relations among the important figures, objects, and setting in a scene.

**extreme close-up**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is very large; most commonly, a small object or a part of the body.

**extreme long shot**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is very small; a building, landscape, or crowd of people will fill the screen.

**fade**: fade-in: a dark screen that gradually brightens as a shot appears. fade-out: a shot gradually disappears as the screen darkens.

**flashback**: an alteration of story order in which the plot moves back to show events that have taken place earlier than ones already shown.

**flash-forward**: an alteration of story order in which the plot presentation moves forward to future events and then returns to the present.

**following shot**: a shot with framing that shifts to keep a moving figure onscreen.

**frame**: a single image on the strip of film. when a series of frames is projected onto a screen in quick succession, an illusion of movement is created.

**hand-held camera**: the use of the camera operator’s body as a camera support, either holding it by hand or using a harness.

**high-key lighting**: illumination that creates comparatively little contrast between the light and dark areas of the shot. Shadows are fairly transparent and brightened by fill light.

**jump cut**: an elliptical cut that appears to be an interruption of a single shot. Either the figures seem to change instantly against a constant background, or the background changes instantly while the figures remain constant.

**long shot**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is small; a standing human figure would appear nearly the height of the screen.

**long take**: a shot that continues for an unusually lengthy time before the transition to the next shot.

**low-key lighting**: illumination that creates strong contrast between light and dark areas of the shot, with deep shadows and little fill light.

**medium shot**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is of moderate size; a human figure seen from the waist up would fill most of the screen.

**mise-en-scene**: all of the elements placed in front of the camera to be photographed: the settings and props, lighting, costumes and makeup, and figure behavior.

**montage**: a synonym for editing. an approach to editing developed by the soviet filmmakers in the 1920s; it emphasizes dynamic, often discontinuous, relationships between shots and the juxtaposition of images to create ideas not present in either shot by itself.

**narration**: the process through which the plot conveys or withholds story information. The narration can be more or less restricted to character knowledge and more or less deep in presenting characters’ mental perceptions and thoughts.

**nondiegetic sound**: sound, such as mood music or a narrator’s commentary, represented as coming from a source outside the space of the narrative.

**offscreen sound**: simultaneous sound from a source assumed to be in the space of the scene but outside what is visible onscreen.

**offscreen space**: the six areas blocked from being visible on the screen but still part of the space of the scene: to each side and above and below the frame, behind the set, and behind the camera.

**pan**: a camera movement with the camera body turning to the right or left. On the screen, it produces a mobile framing that scans the space horizontally.

**plan americain**: a framing in which the scale of the object shown is moderately small; the human figure seen from the shins to the head would fill most of the screen. this is somethings referred to as a medium long shot, especially when human figures are not shown.

**plot**: in a narrative film, all the events that are directly presented to us, including their causal relations, chronological order, duration, frequency, and spatial locations. Opposed to story, which is the viewer’s imaginary construction of all the events in the narrative.

**point-of-view shot**: a shot taken with the camera placed approximately where the character’s eyes would be, showing what the character would see; usually cut in before or after a shot of the character looking.

**racking focus**: shifting the area of sharp focus from one plane to another during a shot; the effect on the screen is called rack-focus.

**scene**: a segment in a narrative film that takes place in one time and space or that uses crosscutting to show two or more simultaneous actions.

**sequence**: term commonly used for moderately large segment of film, involving one complete stretch of action. In a narrative film, often equivalent to a scene.

**shallow focus**: a restricted depth of field, which keeps only one plane in sharp focus; the opposite of deep focus.

**shot**: in shooting, one uninterrupted run of the camera to expose a series of frames. Also called a take. In the finished film, one uninterrupted image, whether or not there is mobile framing.

**shot/reverse shot**: two or more shots edited together that alternate characters, typically in the conversation situation. In continuity editing, characters in one framing usually look left, in the other framing, right over-the-shoulder framings are common in shot/reverse-shot editing.

**sound bridge**: at the beginning of one scene, the sound from the previous scene carries over briefly before the sound form the new scene begins.

**story**: in a narrative film, all the events that we see and hear, plus all those that we infer or assume to have occurred, arranged in their presumed causal relations, chronological order, duration, frequency, and spatial locations Opposed to plot, which is the film’s actual presentation of events in the story.

**take**: in filmmaking, the shot produced by one uninterrupted run of the camera. One shot in the final film may be chosen from among several takes of the same action.

**tilt**: a camera movement with the camera body swiveling upward or downward on a stationary support. It produces a mobile framing that scans the space vertically.

**tracking shot**: a mobile framing that travels through space forward, backward, or laterally.

**wide-angle lens**: a lens of short focal length that affects a scene’s perspective by distorting straight lines near the edges of the frame and by exaggerating the distance between foreground and background planes.

**wipe**: a transition between shots in which a line passes across the screen, eliminating one shot as it goes and replacing it with the next one.

**zoom lens**: a lens with a focal length that can be changed during a shot. a shift toward the telephoto range enlarges the image and flattens its planes together, giving an impression of magnifying the scene’s space, while a shift toward the wide-angle range does the opposite.
